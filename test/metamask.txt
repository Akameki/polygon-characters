It is very possible that the RPC endpoint you are using to connect to the network with MetaMask is congested or experiencing technical problems. I found a solution that may work for you if you have this problem.

For Polygon you can add another RPC endpoint.

Here is a list of RPC endpoints for Polygon and a reminder of how to set it up:
https://docs.dfyn.network/guides/changing-polygons-rpc-endpoint-on-metamask


Demo
- best practice
  - try to start with active account for payment
  - try to start with active account Connected
  - try to start with all inactive accounts disconnected
  - try not to change connection status in the midst of bidding
    - to avoid getting into subsequent confusion state
    - even Brave and Metamask does not agree
Test Case 1.1 - if active account is not connected
  - try to connect to only the active account for bidding
  - try to disconnect from all other accounts
Test Case 2.1 - if active account is connected
  - Metamask prompts
  - Brave does not prompt
  - try to remember to worry - would my wallet pay via other inactive connected accounts?
  - try to remember the risk where the wallet may or may not pay via your active account
Test Case 1.2 - try to avoid switching connect accounts when prompted to avoid in active disconnected account
  - to avoid getting into subsequent confusion state
  - try to remember to second guess your wallet QA process, your web2.0 website QA process
  - try to worry - what if the wallet may not pay via your active account?
Test Case 1.3 - try not to connect to multiple accounts
